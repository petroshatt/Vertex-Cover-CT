# Vertex-Cover-CT
## Project 3 for Complexity Theory course.

Implemented seven algorithms in Java, solving the vertex cover problem on unweighted graphs.
Created a method to generate random graphs.
1. Optimal Algorithm
2. Approximate Algorithm - Removing First Edge
3. Approximate Algorithm - Removing Random Edge
4. Approximate Algorithm - Removing Edge connecting the Maximum Degree Vertex
5. Greedy Algotihm - Removing First Edge
6. Greedy Algotihm - Removing Edge connecting the Maximum Degree Vertex
7. Heuristic Algorithm - Isolating Minimum Vertex, adding it and its neighbors to the cover and removing all edges connecting the cover's vertices
